## What is VECTOR OPS?

VECTOR OPS explores a simple but important problem: operational teams often use separate tools for situational awareness, mission planning, fleet status, logistics, communications and incident management.

The challenge is not only seeing more data. It is understanding **what requires attention, why it matters, what will become a problem next, and what action should be taken**.

VECTOR OPS is conceived as a modular system that combines a shared operational picture with tasking, assets, logistics, communications and decision support.

Its core hypothesis is that the strongest value comes from **cross-domain operational consequences** rather than from another dashboard full of disconnected alerts.

## Core idea

Instead of showing four separate warnings:

- UAV battery low
- communication quality falling
- charging point occupied
- sector coverage at risk

the system should express the operational consequence:

> **Sector Bravo coverage will be lost in 11 minutes.**

…and show the dependencies behind that conclusion together with operator-reviewable options.

## Design principles

- **Modular by design**
- **Shared operational model**
- **Decision-oriented**
- **Cross-domain reasoning**
- **Graceful degradation**
- **Explainable state**
- **Real demonstrator**
- **Feasible by default**
- **Narrow first release, durable foundation**

## Initial capability areas

- Common Operational Picture
- Mission / Task Planning
- Asset Management
- Logistics
- Communications
- Incident / Tasking
- Forecast / Decision Support

## Public demo direction

The first demonstrator will use a **non-weaponized synthetic cascading-infrastructure scenario** grounded in documented dependencies between power, telecommunications, water, access and constrained restoration resources.

The primary operator is a **Dyżurny operacyjny Wojewódzkiego Centrum Zarządzania Kryzysowego (WCZK)** — a real Polish 24-hour crisis-management role responsible for monitoring, analysis, information flow, procedure activation, escalation and documentation.

The public alpha is intentionally narrow: one operator, one operational area and three meaningful coordination or escalation moments. It is being implemented on an extensible modular foundation so later modules and scenarios can be added without rewriting the application core.

## Current discovery questions

- Which exact synthetic disruption should define MVP success?
- Which decisions may the WCZK duty officer initiate, recommend or escalate?
- Which 3–4 modules are necessary to demonstrate the concept credibly?
- What is the minimum viable consequence / forecast engine?
- What should be simulated in-browser and what, if anything, needs a backend?

## Non-goals

The public demonstrator is **not** intended to include weapon control, target engagement, autonomous lethal decision-making, sensitive real-world operational data or production-grade military security infrastructure.

## Next step

Select the exact synthetic scenario, define the WCZK duty officer's decision boundaries and reduce the public-alpha scope to the minimum credible module set.
